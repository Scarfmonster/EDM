# Set the BPM tempo here. This is the same as the tempo field in UTAU.
# If you want a song to be ignored while creating the dataset (for example because it's LAB is not finished yet)
# you can either omit or comment out it's tempo here and it will be ignored.
# Use the LAB/WAV file name without extension
# Example: FileName 100
